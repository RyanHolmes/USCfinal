		<h1 id = "p1"> <b> Empowering You </b></h1> 

		<p>The USC's ultimate goal is <b>enhancing the student experience</b>. Team Litchfield believes that the best way to achieve this is through empowering you. Empowerment means providing high caliber programming, comprehensive support, and better enabling students to pursue their goals.</p>

		<h3 id = "p2" >Mental Health</h3>

		<p>The first step to empowerment is a healthy mind. Team Litchfield will make <b>mental health a priority</b>. There are many ways in which we plan to lobby for mental health (discussed below). We also have many direct action plans to improve mental health services for Western students.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;" >&#8226 The Jack Project – jack.org</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Named after former Queens student Jack Windeler, the <i>Jack Project</i> is a program dedicated to <b>promoting mental health awareness</b> for university students. We will reach out to this group to collaborate on awareness campaigns to normalize issues and empower people to seek help.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Student Assistance Program</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">A <i>Student Assistance Program</i> provides <b>online, phone and app-based mental health resources and counseling to students</b>. Team Litchfield has consulted Aspiria.org to investigate the feasibility of setting up a <i>Student Assistance Program</i> on campus.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">To support this initiative we would work with the university and provincial government to apply for mental health grants. We would also look into including this service in the current student health plan, with the potential to opt-out for students with other coverage.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Aspiria provides psychiatric, financial, life and legal counseling for students. It would also be integrated with existing mental health services to provide comprehensive support. The program would prioritize directing students to existing services when available to ensure that university services are not undermined.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Team Litchfield will work with the new Associate Vice-President Student Experience (AVPSE) to deliver a <i>Student Assistance Program</i> to Western. We are confident this will fundamentally <b>change the way Western students access mental health support</b>, drastically reduce our service availability problems, and <b>cut down unacceptable wait times</b>.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This Program is committed to helping the USC market their existing initiatives to ensure awareness and efficient utilization of existing support services.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Centralized Mental Health Directory</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">With a plethora of support services available on campus, it’s crucial that we <b>simplify the process</b> for students in need so that they can obtain the right support at the right time. We will create a consolidated and <b>easily accessible database of services</b> available. In combination with the <i>Student Assistance Program</i>, this will ensure that our support services are being utilized by those they were meant for, which not only improves mental health outcomes but improves efficiency.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 De-Stressor Programming</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Another way to reduce mental health problems on campus is to alleviate the causes, and the most obvious cause is stress. We will <b>increase our popular de-stressor programming and expand its reach</b> outside of exam periods. We will also encourage councils to collaborate on de-stressor programming to give targeted relief to their own constituencies.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">We will also push for <b>reviews and reforms of academic counseling</b> to reduce unnecessary academic stresses. The amount of students forced to seek accommodations for academic related anxiety is far too high. This will be paired with seminars on test preparation and time management to help further reduce stress.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Mental Health First Aid Training</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Mental health crises can occur at anytime and anywhere. We firmly believe in providing mental health first aid training to people likely to be approached by students in crisis.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Staff and Faculty</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Team Litchfield will work with the new Western AVPSE to get <b>mental health first aid training to professors, TAs, and staff members</b></p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226Student Leaders</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">We will work with the Western AVPSE and Orientation Planning Committee to provide <b>mental health first aid training to Sophs and council members</b></p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Mental health first aid training will equip likely responders to support students in crisis and direct them safely to appropriate resources. It will also promote a higher level of understanding for services available on campus and in the community, and will improve student health outcomes by ensuring that those they are most likely to speak to are knowledgeable enough to recognize their needs and direct them appropriately.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226No Wrong Door Policy</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">The “no wrong door” policy requires any leader, staff member, volunteer, or administrator who is contacted by a student about a concern to take it upon themselves to <b>send that student to the right place to have their concern addressed</b>. This idea has already been introduced at the USC but it needs to be implemented and supported by the university to ensure that applicable personnel are capable of providing such information Team Litchfield believes strongly in the need for this policy.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226Soft Transition Policy</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">The “soft transition” policy supports the “no wrong door” policy by requiring staff, leaders, volunteers, and administrators to tell students where to go and follow up to make sure they get there. This could mean calling ahead in advance of a student or physically accompanying them on the way. We believe this policy is a very important addition to student-staff interactions and that it will help combat the immobilization of students who are unsure what is available to them. <b>Most students only take the initiative to reach out once.</b> We want to make sure they get the help they need.</p>

		<h3 id = "p3" >Spoke To Go</h3>

		<p >We want to improve the student experience by initiating <b>late-night take-out food at the Spoke</b>. This will enable students to buy food without having to go through security checks and produce ID, an inconvenience particularly frustrating for first years. This would mean moving the security check back past the Spoke Cafe.</p>


		<h3 id = "p4" >O-Week Contingency Programming</h3>

		<p>This year's O-Week had significant event cancellations due to severe weather. Team Litchfield will <b>mandate contingency plans</b> for all outdoor and weather-sensitive programming.</p>

		<h3 id = "p5" >Alternative O-Week Planning</h3>

		<p>Not everyone wants to rave every night of O-Week. For those who do there is plenty of great programming. For those who do not, we want to improve the alternative programming to make it more appealing. We will work with OPC and the university to make this happen and empower all our first year students. Western is a fantastic place due in part to the wide variety of students it is able to attract – it is important that we recognize that variety and ensure such a variety of students feel welcomed, and enjoy their O-Week. This starts with <b>making sure programming options are varied and inclusive.</b></p>

		<h3 id = "p6" >Second Year Transitional Experience</h3>

		<p>First year students are very well supported during O-Week and throughout the year. Second year students are subjected to serious culture shock as they transition away from all these support services and take on a lot of new responsibilities. We are committed to <b>providing support services and programming to help with the Second Year Transition.</b></p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226Soft Second Year Student Caucus</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">We will work with Western's new AVPSE to create a second year student caucus as a focus group for <b>identifying areas of concern</b> for second year students. This group would work with councils and the university to raise awareness for second year issues and provide new supports.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Healthy Living Workshops</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">We will partner with campus experts such as Brescia's food and nutrition and FRESH programs and main campus health sciences programs to provide <b>workshops on food skills, lifestyle choices, and fitness</b> for second year students.</p>

		<h3 id = "p7" >Supporting Constituency and Residence Councils</h3>

		<p>Team Litchfield recognizes the valuable role that constituency and residence councils, and clubs play in advocacy, support, and programming. We want to <b>make USC resources more available</b> to these groups to assist them in effectively delivering decentralized and targeted programming. We see enabling other student organizations as a core value of the USC.</p>

		<h3 id = "p8" >Clubs System Reform</h3>

		<p>The USC clubs system currently has 279 rules. Under previous insurance policies and tighter regulations this was necessary. This is no longer the case. We are committed to massively <b>overhauling the clubs system</b>. The replacement of WesternLink provides a great opportunity for this. If elected we will commission a <b>comprehensive review of the clubs system</b> with the goal of cutting red tape and making the system both easier to use and easier to join. Team Litchfield considers it a top priority to ensure that the clubs system is able to provide students with opportunities for leadership, involvement and experience with the least possible degree of difficulty.</p>

		<h3 id = "p9" >Rethinking Programming</h3>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 One Programming Budget</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Right now most USC portfolios have their own programming budgets. This creates a system where everyone feels compelled to spend all the money they are given. We propose <b>moving all the programming dollars into one line</b> under the Vice-President Student Events. Portfolios could then apply for programming funds if and when they need them. We feel this will lead to better use of your money, and more effective high quality programming.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Decentralized Programming</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This year Matt Helfand committed to decentralized programming. We want to continue with this trend. Some programming can be done more efficiently. We will <b>make USC programming support services more available</b> to councils and clubs. Implementing Pod software should make decentralized programming much easier and expand the amount of groups running programming on campus.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Vertically Integrated Programming</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">It is our belief that students’ dollars can be used better by collaborating between the USC, clubs, and councils. This will prevent programming overlap and allow organizations to better leverage their resources. We propose introducing an event categorization and tagging system through Pod to make it easier to find events, collaborate on them, and reduce the likelihood of two groups running the same events at the same time. <b>Vertical integration will allow students to get more value out of their student fees.</b></p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Council Directed Programming</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Most USC programming is decided upon by full-time staff and the executives. We want to give council the option to weigh in on programming priorities and have more input in the types of large events we pursue. This will <b>make our programming more democratic.</b></p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Dedicated Wave Programming Budget</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">The Wave used to have its own dedicated programming budget of roughly $10,000. This money was relocated to the USC's general programming lines. <b>We will move this money back to the Wave to pursue better leveraged programming</b>. As a restaurant and event venue the Wave can better leverage programming dollars than the greater student council can. This money would still be overseen by students through the Wave programming advisory committee composed of four students-at-large.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 HOCO on Campus 2.0</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This year Matt Helfand brought Homecoming to campus. Team Litchfield wants to make this an annual tradition. We will work with the university, community partners, and city to <b>make this on-campus event bigger and better</b>, and to reduce the mob concerns on Broughdale. We will continue to develop the homecoming planning committee and ensure that the USC continues to be a big part of homecoming.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· We will apply for a large licensed liquor area on campus for the weekend</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· We will work with entertainment companies to bring a big and popular artist to campus</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· There will be free pancakes</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· There might be better food too</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· We will explore the idea of a tailgate party outside the stadium</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· We will throw an advance party for the football game at the Spoke</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">· We will work with constituency councils to create kickoff programming and collaborative homecoming programming</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Bring Back Beer Fest</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This year the USC brought in a craft beer festival using the same licensing contract from the homecoming venue. This event was very successful and <b>we want to make it a tradition</b>. We will also look into partnering with some of these breweries for homecoming programming.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Wine Tasting Festival</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Beer Fest was a great event but what if you don't like beer? Wine fest might just be for you! Ontario has plenty of vineyards. We want to investigate the possibility of setting up a wine tasting event at the Wave both as <b>a charity initiative and an opportunity for cultural experiences</b>.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Food Truck Extravaganza</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">The Ghouda truck and Beaver Tails truck have both been very popular this year. We will look into <b>inviting a fleet of food trucks to campus</b> at various times while the weather is nice. Ideal opportunities include: O-Week, Homecoming, or even just a dedicated food truck event.</p>

		<h3 id = "p10" >Teaching Quality</h3>

		<p>Teaching quality is a growing concern for undergraduate students. Western is a research-intensive university and this can lead to teaching quality being neglected. We will work with the new Western AVPSE to <b>improve teaching quality on campus </b>and maintain our reputation for best student experience. Here are some of our ideas:</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Innovative Teaching Grants</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Teaching quality is not prioritized because it is not factored into tenure track. Grants on the other hand are. We will work with the AVPSE, the provincial government, and student organizations to <b>set up innovative teaching grants</b>. These do not need to be expensive. Grants will encourage profs to try new teaching strategies and make classes more interesting. We will try this as a pilot project in the summer semester and then pitch a bigger project to the university.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Community Engaged Learning Opportunities (CEL)</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">We will use the new community engagement commissioner to set up CEL alternatives to conventional assignments. This practice already exists in some programs. We want to increase the popularity of, and awareness for, these programs to <b>give students alternative learning opportunities</b>.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Promoting International Opportunities</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Western boasts an amazing amount of international opportunities through trips and exchange programs. We will work with Western international and Ethnocultural services to increase awareness for these opportunities, <b>help students find financial assistance to go abroad</b>, and support international and exchange students on campus. We want to empower you to see the world.</p>

		<h3 id = "p11" >Professional Development Opportunities</h3>

		<p>Many upper-year students are worried about employment prospects after graduating. We want to work with university services to provide professional development opportunities to all interested students. We will leverage vertically integrated programming <b>to host seminars, development days, and networking events</b>. We will also work with any interested parties to create platforms for students to present and publish papers and research to <b>improve their employment or application prospects</b>.</p>

		<h3 id = "p12" >Protecting Our Environment</h3>

		<p>One of Western's greatest assets is its campus. We will work with the university and the city to <b>keep Western beautiful and sustainable</b>.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Water Sustainability</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Water is increasingly becoming a valuable commodity. While we are fortunate enough to have plenty of water in London, this doesn't mean we should be needlessly wasting or polluting it. Team Litchfield wants to <b>improve water sustainability</b> in campus and encourage alternatives to bottled water.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 More Refill Stations and Water Fountains</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">We will push for more water fountains and bottle refill stations in key locations on campus. These include the rec center, Ivey, University College, and older residences. We will conduct a review of water accessibility on campus to <b>ensure students can get free water</b> just as easily as buying water bottles.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Better Reusable Water Bottles</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">We will push for and provide <b>better quality renewable water bottles</b> on campus. Buying a reusable water bottle quickly pays for itself and provides a cleaner and healthier alternative to disposable bottled water.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Water Usage Survey</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">We will work with the administration and community partners to get statistics on water usage on campus and establish plans to <b>replace outdated and inefficient plumbing</b> appliances. This survey could potentially be a project for engineering students.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Campus Waste Reduction</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Every year you see campaigns about how much garbage campus produces. We are committed to <b>reducing</b> these numbers. Here are some of the ways we propose to do it:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 More Composting on Campus</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">London does not run a composting plant but Western does. Compost is collected and recycled on campus. We will work with Brescia's FRESH program and main campus composting programs to <b>increase the awareness for composting</b> and the amount of bins available. We will also look into adding more recycling bins where needed.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Clothing, Furniture, and E-Waste Recycling</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">These programs already exist but we want to improve awareness for them and make sure that students have <b>access to specialized recycling during peak periods</b> like move-out. This will prevent needlessly wasting materials and overburdening city garbage collection services.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Biodegradable Take-Out Containers</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">The University of Guelph's student pub “The Bullring” famously provides <b>biodegradable take out containers</b>. We are looking into putting these in the Spoke and Wave to reduce garbage. If this program is successful we can push for hospitality services to look into it as well.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Environmental Drink Discount</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">Tim Hortons provides discounts for bringing your own coffee mug. The Spoke should too. We already sell mugs that come with a free serving of coffee. Team Litchfield believes <b>students should be rewarded for being ecologically conscientious</b>. The exact amount of the discount will be determined based on budget projections.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Less Emphasis on Paper in Classes</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">We will work with the Western AVPSE and Senate to push for less reliance on paper in classrooms. This will improve teaching quality and information accessibility and also <b>decrease the amount of wasted paper</b> produced on campus.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Textbook Exchange Program / Forum</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">You cannot log onto Facebook without seeing notices about text books for sale. We will work with (or without) the University to set up an online forum for used textbook sales and trading hosted by the USC. Putting text book sales in a centralized, standardized, and searchable venue will help students <b>find affordable materials</b>, reduce wasted paper, and decrease annoyances on Facebook. We will also integrate this program with a textbook recycling charity program to provide the option for donating used textbooks and allowing the charity to sell used books.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Environmental Leadership</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Sustainable initiatives must be paired with environmental leadership to achieve a sustainable campus. Team Litchfield is committed to providing <b>environmental leadership</b> at Western. This includes:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Sustainability Talks</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">Growing interest in climate change and resource conservation makes sustainability speakers increasingly attractive. We will work to <b>bring sustainability talks to Western</b>. We want to add love of the planet to the One Love Rally by introducing an environmental speaker or environmental awareness video.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">&#8226 Environmental Awareness in O-kits and Leadership Training</p>

		<p style="margin-left:100px;">We believe it is important to promote <b>sustainability and recycling in residence</b>. The best way to do this is through information in o-kits and training for sophs and rez staff. Students should know where to bring their recycling.</p>






		<br><hr class="featurette-divider"><br>

		<h1 id = "p13" ><b>Reaching Out To You</b></h1>

		<p>Team Litchfield is dedicated to improving how the USC and all student groups communicate to their constituents. As a Western student, you pay close to $700 in fees to the USC. Better communication means reaching out to you in ways that are effective, meaningful, and diverse. It also means providing you with more feedback opportunities, and being more receptive to the feedback that we receive. Communication should be building channels that allow us bring better programming, stronger advocacy, events you care about, and ultimately a more democratic USC.</p>

		<h3 id = "p14"> Inbox Marketer – Marketing Seminar</h3>

		<p>We will bring in multimedia marketing company Inbox Marketer to run free seminars on marketing to students. These seminars will be open to anyone interested. We will encourage members of clubs and councils to participate. Expert advice from Inbox will give student groups the tools to better promote their events and keep their members informed.</p>

		<h3 id = "p15"> Pod</h3>

		<p>We will bring in new software to replace 1) WesternLink as an events management tool and 2) Facebook as a group organizing and task management tool. Right now Facebook is the most common organizing tool for students on campus. With the overwhelming amount of notifications people get this is not a good way to organize people. WesternLink is a very clumsy and outdated program.</p>

		<p>Pod will provide a new platform for event proposals, programming collaboration, group management, and task management. Pod allows anyone to create “pods” or groups within greater existing groups. Pod combines the administrative functions of WesternLink with the collaborative functions of Facebook to create a powerful framework for programming and teamwork. We believe that this will revolutionize programming and collaboration on campus.</p>

		<h3 id = "p16"> Western-wide Pod Group</h3>

		<p>We propose the creation of a Western-wide pod that would be publicly accessible and hosted by the USC. Anyone with a valid Western email could create their own groups within this framework. We would also create a smaller USC pod to hold all the councils and USC affiliated clubs and portfolios.</p>

		 <h3 id = "p17">Website</h3>

		<p>The current USC website is not easy to navigate. We will commission a website-mapping initiative to evaluate the website accessibility and make it more navigable. We will also expand the profile information of USC members to make them more accessible as student representatives.</p>

		 <h3 id = "p18">Email</h3>

		<p>Upgrading student emails to Office 365 will greatly increase the value of email as a communications tool for the USC. Larger inboxes mean we can move away from black and white text emails by sending out graphic emails and video links.</p>

		<p>We will use Inbox Marketer's Umpire email analytics and deployment software to reinvent the Mustang Monthly newsletter. This will allow us to customize emails to fit the interests of individual students and improve our ability to collect feedback.</p>

		 <h3 id = "p19">Video</h3>

		<p>Video provides a great concise alternative to text based emails. We will make more use of videos to promote events, make members of council more accessible, and give updates on USC activities.</p>

		 <h3 id = "p20">Physical Media</h3>

		<p>Posters and blackboards are a staple for advertising in the UCC. We will work with Deans and constituency councils to put physical advertising for USC events in other buildings on campus and at affiliate campus. Not everyone walks through the UCC every day, but everyone should be informed about the events their fees pay for.</p>

		 <h3 id = "p21">USC Promos Team</h3>

		<p>Team USC is being reintroduced as a promotions team. This team will take on the direct marketing role in events promotions and reaching out to councils and clubs to collaborate on events promotions.</p>

		 <h3 id = "p22">First Year Student Caucus</h3>

		<p>The removal of residence councilors puts new emphasis on the first year student caucus for communicating with first year students. Team Litchfield is fully committed to reinventing this body to give first year students the representation they need. We will make the USC President available to the caucus as a resource to ensure this group is properly equipped to represent first year issues to the USC.</p>

		<h3 id = "p23"> First Year Town Halls</h3>

		<p>This year residence councilors were removed from the USC. We will compensate for this by holding first year student town halls at residences and the UCC to collect feedback and better address first year concerns. These will be organized with first year student caucus reps.</p>

		<h3 id = "p24"> Council Transparency</h3>

		<p>Right now it can be difficult for students-at-large to keep up with the happenings of USC meetings. We will work to change this by advertising our meeting agendas, publishing them earlier and more accessibly, and holding special meetings (like the budget meeting) at more convenient hours. We will also publish the “sparknotes” version of meeting minutes to give students a general overview of what happened during each meeting. This will increase council accountability and give students more opportunity to give feedback and opinion to their representatives.</p>

		<h3 id = "p25"> Financial Transparency</h3>

		<p>You pay almost $700 in fees to the USC. We want to make it easier to see where your money goes. Restructuring the fees statements is a good start here. We will also provide programming cost reports, USC grants reports, and condensed budget updates.</h4>

		<h3 id = "p26"> Executive Accessibility</h3>

		<p>Team Litchfield believes that outreach must be taken literally. We will hold public office hours at least one hour per week where we will go out on campus and reach out to you for feedback and concerns. We will also continue the commitment to timely email and Facebook responses during work days.</p>

		<h3 id = "p27"> USC Marketing</h3>

		<p>The USC is creating its own internal marketing services. This will be used to better promote our events and those of other student organizations on campus. It is our belief that having dedicated marketing services will greatly improve our ability to promote events giving you the most value for your money.</p>

		<h3 id = "p28"> Improving Democracy</h3>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Scrapping the Slate System</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">While we are happy with our own team, Team Litchfield is adamant about cutting down the slate system. Every year since its creation voter turnout has declined. We will either return to a publicly elected president, or a two-person slate composed of president and VP advocacy.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Reforming the Executive</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Team Litchfield will commission a complete review of the executive portfolios. The executive job descriptions have changed a lot in the last three years. It is time for the excutive composition to be updated to reflect these changes. For example this will likely include making the vice-president communications a hired position to reflect the changes in the communications portfolio.</p>

		<br><hr class="featurette-divider"><br>








		<h1 id = "p29"><b>Representing You</b></h1>

		<p>A central role of the USC is to advocate for, or represent, students. This section outlines how Team Litchfield will bring your issues to the Western Administration, the City of London, and the Provincial Government of Ontario. This coming year presents a lot of political and administrative turnover for Western. Internally we have a new Associate Vice-President Student Experience and two new Deans. Externally, there is a recently elected mayor and city council, a fairly new provincial government, and an upcoming federal election. All of this presents a great opportunity to redefine our advocacy priorities.</p>

		<h3 id = "p30" > Mental Health on Campus</h3>

		<p>Student mental health continues to be a huge priority. We will work with the university to lobby the provincial government for grant money from the recently announced $9 million for mental health.</p>

		<p>Team Litchfield is also committed to pushing for service reviews and upgrades for on campus mental health services and support. Wait lines are too long especially during peak times like midterms and exam season.</p>

		<p>We will push for university policy changes in other areas to reduce student stress as a mental health cause. This includes continuing pushing for a consolidated week long fall reading break tacked on to Thanksgiving weekend and reviewing the exam scheduling policies. We will also work with constituency councils to reform academic counseling practices to reduce peak period stresses.</p>

		<h3 id = "p31" > Positive Media Portrayals</h3>

		<p>City media tends to cast students in a bad light. We will work with the administration to highlight student successes in the media and generate more positive publicity. To do this we will team up with the university's new Associate Vice President Student Experience. We will also create a media relations position in the USC. The city will see more positive student stories!</p>

		<h3 id = "p32" > Safer Campus</h3>

		<p>Lighting – we will push for more lighting and quicker repairs on campus to ensure you aren't walking home in the dark. We want to install more LED lights to cut down on repair frequency and energy use. We will also look into alternating purple and white lights in central areas for spirited illumination.</p>

		<p>Traffic and Congestion – numerous car accidents involving pedestrians over this year have highlighted the need for better pedestrian safety and reduced traffic congestion. We will work with the University Senate to reduce traffic on campus and make walking safer.</p>

		<p>Bike Security – bike theft has been a serious issue on campus for years. We will work with campus police and the administration to increase bike security. This will include pushing for security cameras on popular bike racks and information campaigns about best locking practices.</p>

		<h3 id = "p33" > Rec Center</h3>

		<p>Staying active is an important part of a healthy student lifestyle. The rec center is a great resource for this, however it can use some improvements. Team Litchfield will push the administration and campus rec for some changes to make working out more convenient.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Towel Services</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Complimentary towel services are common at other campuses. We propose making towels free to borrow as long as you scan your ID at the desk.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 More Water Fountains and Refill Stations</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Students commonly complain that there are not enough water fountains and refill stations at the gym. We will take this to the university and ask for more.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 More Lockers</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Lockers are so scarce that people camp outside the gym at 5am to buy them. This is unacceptable. We will push for expansion of locker banks. This is an expensive project and may take more than one year to accomplish but it is a necessary issue.</p>

		<h3 id = "p34" >Better Parking</h3>

		<p>Parking is a serious concern for many students. Convenient spots are hard to find and this makes driving to campus unreliable. We will push to make parking a long-term priority for the university. This fits well with the congestion and traffic priorities of the University Senate.</p>

		<h3 id = "p35" >Wifi</h3>

		<p>Internet is vital to student life on campus. Despite extensive hardware upgrades campus wifi is still problematic. We will continue to work with the Senate and ITS to improve connectivity on campus. We will also help gather usage information and feedback to further improve the wifi infrastructure on campus.</p>

		<h3 id = "p36" >Student Presence on Advisory Boards</h3>

		<p>We agree with the incoming Associate Vice-President Student Experience that students need to have voices in all university decision making bodies. We will work with her to push for student seats on more advisory boards including athletics, housing, and campus rec.</p>

		<h3 id = "p37" >More Focus Groups</h3>

		<p>The university runs focus groups on many student concerns. We will collaborate with them to increase awareness for these groups and make their findings more publicly accessible. This is especially valuable for student mental health initiatives.</p>

		<h3 id = "p38" >Student Donation Funds (SDFs)</h3>

		<p>Every faculty council collects a student donation fund from you along with your tuition. We firmly believe that these funds need to be more transparent about how your money is spent, that they are used only for non-tuition related expenses, and that they are controlled by students without excessive administration influences.</p>

		<p>The incoming dean of Social Science has agreed to give the Social Science Students' Council control of their SDF. Arts and Humanities has control of theirs as well. We want to see this level of freedom in every faculty.</p>

		<br><hr class="featurette-divider"><br>






		<h1 id = "p39" ><b>Internal Platform</b></h1>

		<h3 id = "p40" >Fee Transparency:</h3>

		<p>● Are students getting value for the services they pay for? For starters, they should know where their money is going. It can be confusing to sort through this information, so for both the USC Fee and Ancillary Fee, we will provide a breakdown (via an infographic) showing where their fees are going, and how much of their fees are supporting each program.</p>

		<p>● To follow up with giving students the opportunity to become more financially literate regarding the USC, during the year, we will put out a survey to ask students their feedback on where their fees are being directed, and whether they would like changes made towards the direction of their funds.</p>

		<h3 id = "p41" >Create Better Guidelines for the Faculty Student Donation Fee:</h3>

		<p>● Currently, students pay a varying faculty donation fee along with their tuition. Many students aren’t aware about where this fee goes or the fact that they can opt out of the fund. We will work with faculty councils to create better defined parameters for the Student Donation Fee and what it can be used towards, in order to redirect these funds towards innovative programming and materials. This would aid in avoiding the current issue that exists of the fee being spent on programming and materials that should already be covered by tuition fees.</p>

		<p>● Furthermore, we will work with faculty councils to better promote the fee and opt out better, so students have a better understanding of where their money is going and what their options are.</p>

		<h3 id = "p42" >Homecoming Programming:</h3>

		<p>● Homecoming is a time to celebrate the purple spirit in the fullest! We want to create better on-campus programming that appeals to current undergraduate students during the Homecoming Weekend. Currently programming is heavily directed towards Western alumni, while there are arising complaints from people in the city about the heavy drinking and disturbances on London streets. With more appealing programming, we hope to direct more students on to campus and off the streets to have a fun time without trouble or tickets.</p>

		<h3 id = "p43" >Campus Food:</h3>

		<p>● As students, it’s difficult to always remember to pack a lunch. But it can be even more difficult to make healthy choices when purchasing food on campus. We will lobby for nutrition information to be provided and readily available in the form of pamphlets for eateries on campus to aid students in better understanding what they are eating.</p>

		<p>● Furthermore, to aid students who have dietary concerns, we will lobby for better signage regarding vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options at campus eateries.</p>

		<h3 id = "p44" >Mental Health and Well-Being:</h3>

		<p>● Currently, mental health support services are overwhelmed in all directions, but we want to work with the university and external mental health services to better consolidate mental health resources. Through the No Wrong Door policy, we hope to foster an environment, where even if a student cannot be supported at a particular mental health service, they will be directed to another resource through a different provider so they can quickly and efficiently receive the help and services they require.</p>

		<p>● We want to provide students with simple monthly destressor activities in the UCC for students to participate in as they pass by. Working with the Peer Support Centre, we want to bring some of their programming to a more accessible forefront once a month to provide students with a quick break/pick-me-up.</p>

		<p>● Mental health is a huge issue across campus, but even more so during the exam season. We will advocate for the revision of academic policies that are a burden and cause stress to students. In particular, we want to lobby to revise the exam policy that states that students can only have an exam rescheduled if they have more than 2 in 23 hours to more than 2 in 24 hours. The current policy leaves a lot of students in a position of high stress because more conflicts occur within 24 hours than 23 hours, creating a situation of mental exhaustion and hindering student success.</p>

		<p>● Work with faculty councils to advocate for more privacy and compassion within academic counselling offices encouraging policies where students can choose to write out their concern or reason for coming in, as opposed to verbally expressing their situation (which is often private) in front of other students who are also in the waiting area.</p>

		<h3 id = "p45" >Better Coordination and Communication within the Clubs System:</h3>

		<p>● Western has such a diverse array of clubs, councils and organizations, who each do an amazing job of organizing a variety of events and initiatives throughout the year. However, all those Facebook events and posters can get overwhelming, and it can be difficult to organize your social calendar. Through the Pod system, we want to create a calendar that can be accessible to the entire student body via internet and app form. The calendar will enable students to filter events through a series of tags, making it easier for students to see what events are happening. Feeling stressed and want a destressor? Find a tag related to stress-relief, and you can find out about destressor events occurring throughout campus.</p>

		<p>● Through an accessible calendar, clubs will better be able to organize events as well. They’ll be able to see whether events or initiatives similar to what they are organizing are occurring through other clubs as well, or if it will conflict with other events on campus. We hope this will also foster better communication and collaboration between clubs as well.</p>

		<h3 id = "p46" >Accessibility to Campus and Campus Services:</h3>

		<p>● In recent years (particularly this year), campus has become increasingly congested in too many locations including the libraries, UCC, eateries, etc. Line-ups are too long and it’s difficult to even walk through the UCC sometimes because of how many people are around. We will work with the Western administration and Facilities Management to find solutions to these issues in the long term, such as collaborating on creating and adding more student space.</p>

		<h3 id = "p47" >Focus on Making the USC More Approachable and Accessible:</h3>

		<p>● Create a better focus on advocacy from students based on their points of view by consistently striving to receive feedback via a variety of methods including:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">○ Regular surveys in regards to different issues affecting students which could include prizes as incentives, to increase feedback, while maintaining a short survey length so people can quickly answer questions.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">○ Initiate the creation of an advocacy database. Coordinators would use this to choose projects for the year. Throughout the year, they would be in charge of collecting research via student surveys and/or interuniversity research, to eventually develop a short paper for the end of the year regarding the issue of their choice and suggestions for solutions. These papers would eventually create a library that would make it easier to lobby for student priorities in the future, because of readily available data and evidence in regards to a variety of student issues from a variety of backgrounds.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">○ Have an “office hour” once a week at a more public location, such as the Spoke where executive members of the USC can meet with students, get to know them and create better relationships with the student body. Going up to the office can be intimidating, and we want to hear student feedback, so we’ll come to you instead! This will also better allow students to get to know the USC better and hopefully, feel more comfortable coming forth with their opinions.</p>

		<h3 id = "p48" >Service Awareness Expansion Throughout Campus + Revamping the Peer Support Network Image:</h3>

		<p>● Currently, many people know of the Peer Support Network and Peer Support Centre but don’t really know about what kinds of services are offered through these services. With all the changes that are being made to the Peer Support Network already (relocation and switching to have more involvement from the university via a counsellor), there is a clear need to revamp its image to better embody the services it provides.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">○ Through means such as Team USC, we will promote the network through in-person advertising. We could use members of the USC such as councilors, commissioners, coordinators, exec, etc. to spread the message in person to the student body to make the Peer Support Network more personable.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">○ Use the TVs located around the UCC (including the ones that just display the UCC map currently) to promote all the services the USC offers for students including but not limited to the Peer Support Network, mental health services and events/initiatives related to advocacy, that are applicable and relevant to the student body at large.</p>

		<h3 id = "p49" >Sophing Supports:</h3>

		<p>● Give each Soph Mental Health First Aid training. As a main resource and confidant for first year students who are undergoing a lot of stress, Sophs continuously face issues surrounding mental health and occasionally very serious issues. It is important for sophs to be well-equipped and know how to handle these situations in a safe manner and have the appropriate training for such situations. The mental health module that currently exists was a great first step, but there is a lot more than could be covered and Mental Health First aid would be a good step to take with issues surrounding ways to combat mental health issues and better equip Sophs to deal with commonly-faced situations.</p>

		<p>● Bring back the Soph rest station during O-Week with snacks, refreshments and a place for sophs to rest. It existed two years ago, and was a great asset to help Sophs try to avoid burn out during the week. It allowed much needed rest which was important for the wellness and well-being of all Sophs.</p>

		<h3 id = "p50" >Create a Centralized Resource Directory:</h3>

		<p>● Create a <i>Centralized Resource Directory</i> for students to access with answers to commonly asked questions and links to commonly needed websites in a centralized location. This could help students avoid time searching through the exhaustive number of Western websites and get answers to their concerns quickly and efficiently.</p>

		<h3 id = "p51" >Recognize Student Achievements Across the Board:</h3>

		<p>● We have a diverse, innovative and talented student body, so why not recognize them? In the same way how athletes are recognized every year, we believe many more students deserve recognition. Every month, we want to select one male and one female student of the month, who is making strides at Western whether it be academically or in extra-curriculars. They’ll be publicly recognized for their achievements and receive certificates which can be used for future applications, etc.</p>

		<p>● Our music faculty is extremely talented, and deserve to be recognized for all their hours of practice and hard-work! As opposed to hiring opening acts for big performances on campus, we believe music students should be given an opportunity to perform for large audiences and be the opening acts! Also, we’d like to host a show for the Western student body, featuring the talents of our music students.</p>

		<h3 id = "p52" >Create a ‘Safe Space’ at the Rec Centre:</h3>

		<p>● With such a fit campus, it can be intimidating and scary for beginners at the Rec Centre to get started! We want to create beginner classes for those who are new to rec centre, to have a safe space to get started on their fitness classes. Classes that would be beneficial students include activities such as proper weight training and form. For those who are shy and nervous to be at the racks for weight training, these classes can take place within the smaller gyms, out of sight until they’re ready and confident to be at the weight racks on their own!</p>

		<h3 id = "p54" >Making Life Easier</h3>

		<p>It’s often the smallest things that make the biggest difference. Team Litchfield will continue to advocate for some simple changes that will make your life in London a little easier!</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 7-Day Garbage Collection</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Having garbage pickup consistently on the same day will make life easier for students. We will press for this change in service and work to make remembering garbage day easier in the mean time</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 1-Piece Bus Pass</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Other universities have had a single piece bus pass for years. Team Litchfield will continue to work on this goal by pushing for the program to be implemented starting with the incoming class of first year students.</p>

		<h3 id = "p55" >Collaboration</h3>

		<p>The USC often works alone and misses opportunities to partner with other groups striving for the same goals.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Active partnerships</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Team Litchfield will actively collaborate and work together on projects with other student groups and external organizations. Let’s break down silos and end duplication.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 For-profit partnerships</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">In the past the USC has not partnered with for-profit institutions. Team Litchfield is open to working with for-profit institutions to provide opportunities and programming that meets the needs of students.</p>

		<h4 style="margin-left:50px;">&#8226 Promote external student-friendly initiatives</h4>

		<p style="margin-left:50px;">There are a lot of opportunities outside of Western for students. Team Litchfield will actively promote programming that is off-campus but in the interest of students.</p>

		<h3 id = "p56" >Civic Involvement</h3>

		<p>Being an active member of the community is more than a way to meet new people, it’s our civic duty. Team Litchfield is committed to make civic life easier for students.</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Civic Engagement Coordinator</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">This coordinator will be a new role in the External portfolio focused on helping students become more engaged with their community through organizing events like neighborhood BBQs, ensuring student concerns are noted and facilitating the continuation of our Good Neighbor Campaign</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Increasing Civic Engagement</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">The City of London is very interested in increasing student engagement in the city and retaining students after graduation. We will work with the university and city to provide more opportunities for student engagement. This includes promoting community engaged learning opportunities, and increasing awareness for city council activities. We will also create a new civic engagement coordinator to lead civic engagement initiatives and work with community partners like the London Economic Development Corporation to find short and long-term local employment for students.</p>

		<h1><b>Reaching Out To You</b></h1>

		<h3 id = "p57" >Tangible Advocacy</h3>

		<p>Representing students is often a very slow process. Months and even years are spent reviewing policy and attending meetings. We can’t promise to get results faster but we can make the tasks easier to get a handle on… literally!</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Showcase the USC’s efforts</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">An on-campus <i>Advocacy Awareness</i> campaign will be run each term to give students a chance to learn about what we are advocating for and also meet the volunteers and student leaders working on their behalf.</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Your concerns matter</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">If you want something improved it often seems like your concern is filed away and you never hear back. We’ll change that with a commitment to follow up and provide regular updates on our progress. We’ll also integrate our efforts with social media so that you can submit concerns via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>

		<h3 id = "p58" >Open Advocacy</h3>

		<p>What does your USC Executive do? Team Litchfield is committed to being open with our advocacy efforts so that you can easily find the answer to that question!</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Transparent schedules</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">The VP External travels a lot and it can be hard for students to know where they are and what they’re doing. I’m committed to posting my schedule weekly.</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 User-friendly exec reports</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">Currently the Executive gives monthly reports at Council. However, these are often posted months later with audio in a separate video. Team Litchfield will post exec reports monthly that are user-friendly!</p>

		<br><hr class="featurette-divider"><br>




		<h1><b>Representing You</b></h1>

		<h3 id = "p59" >Your Advocate</h3>

		<p>The USC is your student government and we should be there to support you in your advocacy goals.</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Advocacy Support</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">Team Litchfield is committed to providing advocacy support to any student group that wishes to advocate for a cause the effects the quality of life of undergraduate students at Western</p>

		<h4 style = "margin-left:50px">&#8226 Student Input</h4>

		<p style = "margin-left:50px">We will also ensure that seeking input from students-at-large and stakeholder groups are codified into the development of policy papers and stances in the future.</p>

		<h3 id = "p60" >Being Visible</h3>

		<p>Team Litchfield is also committed to make the USC more visible at local London events. We will ensure that a representative from Council is present at all major City of London occasions and we will strive to attend events held by local citizen groups.</p>

		<h3 id = "p61" >Maintaining Police Relations</h3>

		<p>This year we significantly improved police relationships. This year’s USC executive is signing a memorandum of understanding with the London Police Service. Team Litchfield will continue this trend of positive relations. We will leverage our relationship with former Project L.E.A.R.N. supervising sergeant Tyler Cowan to give ride-alongs to student leaders to promote a better understanding with the police. We will have regular meetings with the LPS to identify and reduce problems before they get out of hand.</p>
