			<h1>Jack Litchfield</h1>
			<h4 > My name is Jack Litchfield and I am running to be your next University Students Council President. I am currently in fourth year honours specialization political science.</h4>
			<h4 >My campaign is based upon a lot of USC experience. I have been involved with student government at Western for the last four years.</h4>
			<h4 >I have been interested in student government since meeting USC President Andrew Forgione at an “Off to Western” event in Cambridge before first year. I ran unsuccessfully for Saugeen rep in first year. I joined the varsity fencing team and went to OUAs. I sat as a member-at-large on Social Science Students' Council and the Political Science Students' Association.</h4>
			<h4 >My first involvement with the USC was in second year. I ran for SSSC Councilor in the bi-election. Joining the USC in October. I sat on the University Affairs standing committee. I worked extensively on the Turf Fields project.</h4>
			<h4 >In third year I served as an SSSC/FIMSC Senator and Chair of the Long-Term Planning and Budget Committee. These positions gave me a great deal of insight into the operations of both the USC and the University. I worked a lot on student donation fund and ancillary fee policy, removing CIS banned drugs from body systems nutrition, and reforming academic counseling. As LTPB chair I worked on the USC strategic plan, USC grants policy, and the USC budget.</h4>
			<h4 >I currently serve as president of the Social Science Students' Council and again as LTPB chair. As president I have re-introduced Social Science academic programming in our new annual Academic Conference featuring Maude Barlow and Conrad Black. I also held a Homecoming Kickoff event, revitalized our annual formal ball, and held a collaborative concert with the USC where we brought in EDM artist Audien. I have gained promises for more autonomy for the Social Science Student Donation Fund and more reforms for academic counseling. My LTPB chair duties have carried over from last year.</h4>
			<h4 >I have also served on the social science decanal selection committee in choosing the new Social Science Dean. I represented Western at the 2013 Canadian Political Science Students' Association in Vancouver and won hosting rights for the 2014 conference at Western. I sat on the conference committee as Internal Liaison Director.</h4>
			<h4 >All of these experiences have given me a great appreciation for Western's claim to best student experience. I am running for USC president with the goal of inspiring this same appreciation in thousands of students, of having a positive impact on as many students as possible, and ultimately making Western an even more amazing school than it already is.</h4><br>
			<h4>It is with great excitement that I throw in my name for USC president. I look forward to the next two weeks and hope I can count on you support!</h4><br>

			<h4>Sincerely, </h4><br><br>

			<h4>-Jack Litchfield</h4> <br> <br>

			<h1>Richard Sookraj</h1>
			<h4>I am currently a fourth year MIT and Political Science major hailing from Mississauga! My first three years of university were spent in Perth Hall as a frosh, an RA and a don, before moving to London Hall for this year. I’ve loved working with first years, and can honestly say that every year I leave inspired by the ambitious and hard-working students I meet.</h4>
			<h4>Currently I’m serving as the VP External for the FIMS Students’ Council. I am also an Undergraduate Senator-at-Large, meaning that I get to represent your needs and concerns related to Academic Policy to our University. I’ve been in this role a few times, as I used to serve as an Undergraduate Senator for FIMS and Social Science as well as the USC’s Municipal Affairs Commissioner in the external portfolio.</h4>
			<h4>Outside of Western I’m a founding member of the London Youth Advisory Council and I’ve served on the board of directors for Hope’s Garden, the Peel Children and Youth Initiative and, the Mayor’s Youth Advisory Committee of Mississauga. All of these initiatives have focused on community building outside of my student involvement as I really do recognize that it’s important for us to build city communities that are influenced by students too.</h4>
			<h4>I’ve developed a strong track record of working with community stakeholders, politicians and students to deliver results and improve the undergraduate experience at Western. When I’m not working away on a project, I really enjoy traveling! So far I’ve been to East Asia and Cyprus and hope to check out Europe on my next trip!</h4> <br> <br>

			<h1>Dilani Logan</h1>
			<h4>Hello! </h4>
			<h4>I’m Dilani Logan, and I’m running to be your Vice President Internal of the USC. I am a fourth year student, who is currently completing a Double Major in Medical Science and Spanish Language & Hispanic Cultures. </h4>
			<h4>In terms of experiences, this past year I had the privilege of being the Vice President of Student Events for the Science Students’ Council, where I received the opportunity to work with two commissioners and 19 department representatives to organize a variety of fun and innovative programming to assist and connect science students. For two years in a row before this, I served as the Student Events-at-Large Commissioner on the SSC, and helped assist with similar programming initiatives. Furthermore, in my second year, I also had the opportunity to be the President of the Delaware Hall Residents’ Council and lead over 30 members to organize initiatives and events, and advocate for the needs of residents within the building. </h4>
			<h4>Outside of student council, I have been happy to serve as both a Delaware Hall and Science Soph throughout my undergraduate experience. As well, I was on the executive of both the Alzheimer’s Western Club and Western Students for Partners-in-Health Canada clubs. All of these experiences have provided me with the opportunity to meet, engage and work with Western’s large, motivated and unique student body. </h4>
			<h4>I feel so lucky to have an had a wonderful Western experience over the past four years, and I want to make sure that you reach fourth year feeling the same way too! Student councils have always been an interest of mine because of their ability to reach out, empower and connect students. I am very excited to meet you over the next few weeks, hear your feedback and hopefully, advocate for and represent your wants, desires and concerns to create positive growth!</h4><br>
			<h4>Here for you,</h4><br>
			<h4>-Dilani Logan</h4><br><br>
